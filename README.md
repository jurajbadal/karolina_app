      - Comprehensive quality overview
      - Historical performance comparison
      - Actionable insights
      - Continuous improvement tracking

   ## Visualization Tools
      - Grafana
      - Kibana
      - Custom dashboard solutions

## This version:
- Keeps it extremely concise
- Assumes package.json contains all prerequisite details
- Provides simple installation and test running instructions
## Setup and Quick Start
1. Clone repository
2. Run npm install in CLI
   ```bash
   npm install 
3. Execute tests using provided commands
   ### Headless Mode (Default)
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   
4. Execute tests using provided commands
   ### Headed Mode (with browser visibility)
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --headed

## After running Playwright tests, the HTML report is automatically generated: 

In the playwright-report directory. This report provides a detailed, interactive view of your test results, including:
Test status (passed/failed)
Duration of each test
Detailed error messages
Screenshots and trace logs for failed tests
To view the HTML report, you can typically open the index.html file in the playwright-report folder using a web browser. This gives you a comprehensive overview of your test execution.

## The REPORTS folder contains additional types of reports:
   These supplementary reports complement the Playwright test reports by providing:

      Accessibility insights
      Performance metrics

### Accessibility Reports

Likely generated from accessibility testing tools
Checks web page compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG)
May include:
   Accessibility violations
   Severity of issues
   Recommendations for improvements
Based on the accessibility report findings 11 total errors, here are some recommendations to improve the design and address the accessibility issues:
   1. Insufficient Contrast
   2. Insufficient Contrast
In a demo mode, accessibility might not be the primary focus. However, it's still good practice to be aware of potential accessibility issues.

### Generated from K6 performance testing
   Provides performance and load testing results
   Typically includes:
      Response times
      Request rates
      Error rates
      Resource utilization

   ### K6 Load Test Results
      - Virtual Users: 10
      - Duration: 30 seconds
      - Key Metrics:
         * Response time
         * Request success rate
         * System load performance

   
# Tractive Demo Application Testing

## Project Overview
This project focuses on testing an existing form in demo mode, with limitations on creating new forms.

## Testing Approach
- Form Validation Testing
- Existing Form Update Verification
- Data Change Validation

## Key Constraints
- Cannot create new forms
- Limited to updating existing form in demo mode
- Focuses on data validation and change tracking

## Test Scenarios
- Validate form input changes
- Verify data modification process
- Check form validation mechanisms

# Form Input Validation Observations

## Specific Input Challenges

### First Name Input
- Allows appending text to existing name
- No clear validation for complete name entry
- Potential issue with overwriting or extending existing names

### Last Name Input
- Displays an unexplained icon in the input field
- Unclear whether the icon is a standard feature or a design anomaly
- Requires clarification on its purpose and functionality

### Date of Birth Input
- Restricted to a 3-step selection process
  * Separate selections for year
  * Month selection
  * Date selection
- Limitations:
  * Cannot directly input full date
  * No option to manually correct or validate entire date
  * Potential usability constraint for users

### Phone Number Input
- Lacks robust international format validation
- Allows indefinite number of digits
- No clear constraints on:
  * Maximum length
  * Country-specific formatting
  * Valid phone number structure

### Invoice Data Inputs
- No mechanism to reuse existing personal information
- Lacks efficiency in data entry
- Missing features:
  * Copy from previous inputs (e.g., first name, last name)
  * Auto-fill or suggestion mechanisms

## Recommended Improvements
- Implement comprehensive input validation
- Add clear error messaging
- Create more flexible input methods
- Develop consistent UI/UX for form interactions

## Demo Mode Insights

### Purpose and Potential
